    This a "simple" project to see how skilled i am with x86_64 assembly, for sure
    the core idea is the snake game but it also implements a RECORD file which
    stores the highest score, you can also give an username to be remembered by using
    P flag.

    $ make
    $ ./snake P playername

    THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN LEFT BEHIND SINCE I GOT BORED DUE TO THE AMOUNT
    OF CODE NEEDED TO KEEP THIS UP, EVERYTHING WORKS FINE EXCEPT DATE HANDLING

    THE MAIN IDEA WAS IMPLEMENTED CORRECLY THOUGH
